`{uptime}`

The time since the stream has been started.

Example response: `3 hours 18 mins`

**Be aware:**  
There can be a delay of 1-3 minutes for it to start responding.  
If the stream shutdowns and resumes within 1 hour the counter resumes.  
So you will not lose your uptime in case of a crash.
